# liblxcc - LinuX Crash Collector

Linux library to generate and send crash reports

---

## Why do I need this?

Imagine you develop and ship linux applications to your clients. These are
a lot of instalations over the globe. What if one of them crash somewhere?

There are 3 possible ways:
- Dont even bother until client complains and eventially quit...
- Log on the remote machine and investigate full core dump (if it's possible)
- Use libLXCC to collect small yet usefull report and recieve a notification!

## How it works?

Install dependencies and compile library:

```
$ sudo apt-get install build-essentials
$ ./pybld.py
```

Example will be here...

## What else can it do?

## How can I help?
